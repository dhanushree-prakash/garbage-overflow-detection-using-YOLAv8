Project Title: YOLOv8 Garbage Overflow Detection with Flask Web App

Description:
This project detects overflowing garbage bins in real-time using YOLOv8 object detection. 
It provides a web interface built with Flask where users can view live detection results 
and get notifications for full bins. 

Folder Structure:
1. source_code/        -> Contains all source code files
2. Executable/         -> Compiled executable files (if any)
3. Project_Report/     -> Project report in Word format
4. PPT/                -> Final viva presentation
5. Video/              -> Demonstration video
6. Journal_Paper/      -> Journal paper in Word format
7. Abstract/           -> One-page abstract
8. Readme.txt          -> Instructions to run the project

Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Recommended IDE: VS Code, PyCharm, or any code editor
- Webcam or video feed for live detection

Python Libraries:
- ultralytics
- opencv-python
- Flask
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional)
- torch

Installation Steps:
1. Navigate to the source_code folder:
   cd source_code

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate environment:
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # If requirements.txt is not available, install manually:
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python Flask numpy matplotlib torch

Execution Steps:
1. To run the Flask web application:
   python app.py

2. Open a web browser and go to:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/

3. Upload an image or start live detection to see overflowing bins highlighted.

Notes:
- Ensure that yolov8n.pt (YOLOv8 model) is present in the source_code folder.
- You can retrain the YOLOv8 model using your custom dataset if required.
- For any issues with video feed, make sure your webcam is connected and not used by other applications.
